You can also leave comments at the bottom of this page if you think it can be useful for other readers.\nNote 1: some of the sections have become out-dated or not relevant anymore, in big part I believe thanks to RMIT/ITS providing much better and reasonable infrastructure (e.g., allowing ssh to the outside), which is fantastic and welcome!. If you spot an updated or not relevant part, let me know and I will mark it as such.\nNote 2: in July 2021, I migrated the page to a GitHub Gist; and in Jan 2022 to my home page. I have then deleted most of the irrelevant sections that were in the original document](/linux-rmit.git/linux-rmit-old.pdf).\n  Linux @ RMIT   Printing at RMIT  Mounting your goanna/yallara account locally  myDesktop: Running RMIT Windows remotely from your Linux Box  SSH to an outside machine via tunneling   THE AUTOMATIC WAY - TUNNELING VIA RMIT HTTP PROXY  THE MANUAL WAY - TUNNELING VIA GOANNA    SSH into an RMIT machine from outside  Accessing RMIT resources (e.g., articles from subscribers, etc.) from outside  Mounting RMIT home drive    Contributors  Printing at RMIT Note (April 2018): Printing now exposes a bonjour/airprint interface called rmit-global located on the server pcutprdap02\nIt only seems to work for E number users (not student accounts), but doesn’t require any PaperCut client to be installed as it does the authentication with its own interface. Works without any further configuration on OSX.\nThis is how to print in the new Think Print system ( http://www.rmit.edu.au/its/thinkprintl ; you won\u0026rsquo;t find any instructions to Linux systems, Linux is not even mentioned!).\n  Get the PaperCut client. The system uses PaperCut print management software. You then need to run the client in your Linux box. You can download the server+client from PaperCut web site itself, and extract from there the client part. You would need to do some configuration there too though ;-) Or you can just download our zip file package here, which is already configured for RMIT network.\n  Run the PaperCut client. The system uses a \u0026ldquo;popup\u0026rdquo; authentication to match the username with the IP address from where the job originated. Therefore, the PaperCut client needs to be running in the background. So, just run the pc-client-linux.sh script to start it and use your RMIT username/password.\n You may want to replace the script pc-client.linux.sh that comes with it with an improved one that works as symbolic link and also runs in the background so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t block. Get it at the bottom of this page or clik here and overwrite the default script.    Install LPD Printer. Next you need to install a printer queue in your Linux system:\nPrinter Type: LPD\rHost: `winsprdps01r001.rmit.internal`\rQueue: `Ricoh-Global-Client`\rDriver: Ricoh Aficio MP C3002 PS\r   After the setup, just send a print job and the PaperCut client should \u0026ldquo;popup\u0026rdquo; for username+password. Hopefully, you should get the printout from the nearest printer (after a swipe and few clicks!).\nFinally, there is a web page to check print history and other bits of info at http://pcutprdap01.rmit.internal:9191/\nGood luck!\nAcknowledgement: the non-trivial research to find all this and make it work is due to PhD student Nitin Yadav, big thanks to him for all of us Linux users!\n Comment for Fedora 18, x64: I had a few issues when upgrading to Fedora 18, x64 and thought this might be useful to others - It seems the printer queue string is completely ignored in the new GUI. I\u0026rsquo;ve just got it working, manually entering \u0026ldquo;lpd://winsprdps01r001.rmit.internal/Ricoh-Global-Client\u0026rdquo; in the cups config page (http://localhost:631). I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s important but I\u0026rsquo;m using the \u0026ldquo;Ricoh Aficio MP C3002 PS\u0026rdquo; driver which came with the F18 distribution and I added myself to the \u0026ldquo;lp\u0026rdquo; group. Comment Kubuntu: In order to set-up the printer on Kubuntu (KDE), it is necessary to use \u0026ldquo;system-config-printer\u0026rdquo; in terminal instead of using the GUI (it seems that kcmshell4 ignores the queue in the configuration). The drivers are already available and accessible via system-config-printer and there is no need to include PPD file manually.  Mounting your goanna/yallara account locally Note: goanna/yallara has been decommissioned as far as I know\u0026hellip; But this would work for other unix-based systems.\nIt is possible and easy to mount directories in goanna.cs in your Linux box as a user, including your home directory. This will allow you to work on files stored in goanna as if they were part of your desktop file system. To do that, we can use the FUSE library which mounts file systems in the user space via ssh. This avoids then the complicate use of Samba or NFS shares (which RMIT does not provide anyways!).\nSo, suppose I (user ssardina) want to mount my home directory at goanna.cs in a local directory called ~/goanna-home. It is as simple as executing the following command:\n$ sshfs -o uid=`id -u`,gid=`id -g`,workaround=rename,reconnect,follow_symlinks ssardina@goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au:/home/s/ssardina ~/goanna-home\r Now, in ~/goanna-home I basically have access to my home directory in goanna.cs ! So simple\u0026hellip; Observe the permissions you will have on all files and directories there are the very same you would have if you log in into goanna.cs via ssh interactively (despite the fact that in your filesystem it will appear as if owned everything).\nFinally, to unmount the directory we can just run:\n$ fusermount -u ~/goanna-home\r Of course, one can also mount in the same way the directory /research\nFinally, if I do not want to issue the above large sshfs statement every time I want to mount the filesystem, I can add the following line to /etc/fstab to mount the remote filesystem into local directory /mnt/goanna-ssardina/ssardina:\nsshfs#ssardina@goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au:/home/s/ssardina /mnt/goanna-ssardina/ssardina fuse workaround=rename,user,reconnect,uid=1000,gid=500,follow_symlinks,fsname=sshfs#ssardina@goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au:/home/s/ssardina 0 0\r You need to replace the username, uid and gid numbers, and mounting location. Then, to mount the filesystem we can just run:\n$ mount /mnt/goanna-ssardina/ssardina  Obs: to avoid sshfs asking for password authentication every time you issue the mounting command, it is best to set up your ssh configuration (in goanna.cs) so that no password will be required. This involves basically adding the RSA key of your local system into the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 at goanna.cs. [just google \u0026ldquo;no password ssh\u0026rdquo; and will be get lots of pages explaining this].\nmyDesktop: Running RMIT Windows remotely from your Linux Box You can still run full RMIT Coorporate Windows from your Linux box. To do that you just need to install the Citrix Client. THis worked form me on Linux Mint 18 (Using Ubuntu 16.04) on Feb 2017:\n Get the icaclientWeb_13.10.0.20_amd64.deb package from Citrix (version as of March 2021) Install the package: sudo dpkg -i icaclientWeb_13.10.0.20_amd64.deb Add more SSL certificates and Chrome pluging by following steps 5 \u0026amp; 9 in CitrixICAClientHowTo Start the Windows system by visiting and logging in into mydesktop.rmit.edu.au via Chrome Select an application, like Chrome or Firefox or X. It will download an .ica file.  for example, my file was named RGVsaXZlcnlDb250cm9sbGVycy5Hb29nbGUgQ2hyb21l.ica   Either tell the browser to open with the Citrix Receiver Client or download the .ica file and click on it and the application (e.g., Chrome) should start!  in Chrome, it seems one has to download the .ica file and then click on it; in Firefox you can instruct Firefox to open the file with the Citrix Receiver Client.    SSH to an outside machine via tunneling NOT RELEVANT ANYMORE (Oct 2017) - One can ssh outside without any problem (good!)\nSuppose you want to ssh from your office Linux desktop to server cs.outofrmit.edu which is outside RMIT network. Initially, you cannot: you will have to login to goanna.cs and ssh from there to cs.outofrmit.edu. We can solve this by creating a permanent \u0026ldquo;tunnel\u0026rdquo; to X via either RMIT http proxy or goanna.cs. For that there is a clean automatic way and a more \u0026ldquo;manual\u0026rdquo; one:\nTHE AUTOMATIC WAY - TUNNELING VIA RMIT HTTP PROXY (thanks to Steven Shapiro for coming up with this one!)\n  Install proxytunnel application; it is very standard and most distributions have them in their repositories (e.g., Ubuntu).\n  Add this to your ~/.ssh/config file:\nHost cs.outofrmit.edu\rServerAliveInterval 30\rProxyCommand /usr/bin/proxytunnel -p aproxy.rmit.edu.au:8080 -P \u0026lt;your NDS account\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;your password\u0026gt; -d cs.outofrmit.edu:22\r The ServerAliveInterval line is used to keep the connection up by sending occasional NULL packets. Such option depends on the ssh client (in this case OpenSSH) and not proxytunnel itself, so check your ssh system. If you use Debian-based system the option is called ProtocolKeepAlives instead (thanks Timothy Jones for pointing that out!).\nI believe the authentication credentials (option -P) is not required anymore (Jan 2015) and can be dropped.\nAnother, possibly simpler way, is to just add this using nc:\nHost *\rProxyCommand nc -X connect -x proxy.rmit.edu.au:8080 %h %p\r This will tunnel every host, but it can easily be use per host if desired.\nrun ssh cs.outofrmit.edu and you should first get something like:\r Via aproxy.rmit.edu.au:8080 -\u0026gt; cs.outofrmit.edu:22\n  THE MANUAL WAY - TUNNELING VIA GOANNA This are the steps:\nFirst, create the tunnel:\n$ ssh -L 9922:cs.outofrmit.edu:22 goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au\r This of course creates an ssh session to goanna.cs, but moreover it creates a tunnel from your local port 9922 in your desktop to port 22 at server cs.outofrmit.edu (where the ssh server should be listening). So, everything that goes to port 9922 of your local machine will be forwarded to port 22 of server cs.outofrmit.edu via (the ssh-connection to) goanna.cs.\nNext, we can ssh into server X by connecting with ssh to our local port 9922:\n$ ssh localhost -P 9922\r This will then open an ssh connecting to the remote server cs.outofrmit.edu as desired.\nImportant: The ssh connection opened in step (a) must remain opened. If it closes, then the ssh connection opened in step (b) will also be broken.\nObs: One can create several tunnels in the same ssh connection (a) above, by simply adding more -L statements. Make sure, though, to use different local ports for each different tunnel.\nSSH into an RMIT machine from outside Suppose now you want to ssh into an internal machine X within RMIT network from outside (e.g., your home). The manual way is to first ssh into an internal server in RMIT that is exposed to the outside world, and then ssh to the specific machine X.\nYou can do that all in one shot by adding the following to ~/.ssh/config:\nHost myrmit-desktop\rHostname \u0026lt;IP of the machine to ssh into\u0026gt;\rUser \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\rCiphers arcfour\rClearAllForwardings yes\rProxyCommand ssh \u0026lt;username-at-goanna\u0026gt;@goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au nc %h %p\r Here, goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au is the server inside RMIT that is exposed to the outside (and that you have access to, of course). Now, you can just run \u0026ldquo;ssh myrmit-desktop\u0026rdquo; and it should work! If you don\u0026rsquo;t have an account in goanna you can achieve the same thing with yallara.\nAccessing RMIT resources (e.g., articles from subscribers, etc.) from outside First, if you are trying to get an article as if you were inside RMIT network, just access access it via the proxy by prefixing the URL with this Proxy link:\n https://login.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/login?url=So, suppose you want to access this paper from off campus:\n https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8468047/\nThen you would visit\n https://login.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/login?url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8468047/\nAnother example: to get Google Scholar via the RMIT proxy by visiting the link:\n https://login.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/login?url=http://scholar.google.com.au/\nOR better still:\n https://scholar-google-com-au.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/\nFor a more general solution, from terminal, set up a port forwarding via some ssh machine inside RMIT that you have access (yeap, you need one!), say coreteaching01.csit.rmit.edu.au:\n$ ssh -D 9999 coreteaching01.csit.rmit.edu.au\r Then, set up the Proxy of your browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to localhost on port 9999. All the traffic from your browser will go to port 9999, which will go via coreteaching01.csit.rmit.edu.au as if you were inside RMIT network.\nAs changing the proxy back and forth in your browser every time you need is painful, you may want to use an extension to do this, such as FoxyProxy (for some reason the FoxyProxy extension for Chome does not seem to work; Firefox works well). Finally, when you visit a page it is like doing it inside the RMIT network.\nMounting RMIT home drive First of all you can access your home directory at https://mydrive.rmit.edu.au using a browser.\nTo mount this directory in your system follow this:\n Samba server: smb://eXXXXX@rmit.internal/USRHome/eh5/eXXXXX Domain: rmit.internal  NOTE: the \u0026ldquo;eh5\u0026rdquo; component will be different for each user. It is based on the last 2 digits of your e-number:\n  We use el if the second to last digit is between 0 and 5, and eh if it is between 6 and 9.\n  Last number is the same as your e-number. So, for example:\n  the path for user e76763 is \u0026ldquo;eh3\u0026quot;: \u0026ldquo;h\u0026rdquo; because second to last digit is 6 and 3 because it is the last digit of the staff number.\n  the path for user eE05411 would be \u0026ldquo;el1\u0026rdquo; (\u0026quot;l\u0026rdquo; because second to last digit is 1).\n  The elX/ehX scheme works the same way for students, except that e is replaced by s for students. Its easier to just cut and paste it from your mydrive though :).\nTo set up a more permanent link, you can add this to your /fstab as follows:\n//rmit.internal/eh\u0026lt;N\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;EXXXX\u0026gt; /mnt/rmithome cifs noauto,user,credentials=/home/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/.mydrive,uid=\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\r and create a file .mydrive in your home folder containing one line:\nusername=EXXXXX\r Make sure you have mount.cifs (e.g., install package cifs-utils)\nThen, just issue command:\n$ sudo mount /mnt/rmithome\r Note: This was all taken from Shane Culpepper\u0026rsquo;s and Ron van Schyndel\u0026rsquo;s emails (April 2013).

If so, you must then read this!\nMost of the requests I receive about PhD supervision/application are spam or mass non-targeted requests (i.e., messages sent to many academics). I will only respond to you if I believe they are genuine and informed requests. For that you should show that you know my research interests/expertise and that you have similar interests; otherwise you may never receive a reply.\nUnfortunately, I do not generally have funding for students. When I have funding, I advertise them explicitly. There are some scholarship available at RMIT University (see point 7 below), but note these are extremely competitive for international applicants.\nPotential student interns: I do not usually have funding for internships. When I do, I try to recruit from good RMIT students. I am unable to consider any requests for paid internships.\nIf you have any questions about PhD application (including funding), you can contact me or HDR Coordinators A/Prof. Jeffrey Chan or Prof. Xiuzhen (Jenny) Zhang.\nApplication Process There are basically four steps to apply to PhD program:\n Check for eligibility: can you do a doctorate program? Identify your topic-project and potential supervisor. In your application you will need that. Contact the potential supervisor, explain your case: why you want to do PhD in that area and with him/her. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get his/her potential interest then it makes no sense to continue. Apply for entrance to the PhD program. This is done in two phases:  Submission of Expression of interest (EOI). This will depend on step 2 above. Submission of Full Application, if EOI is approved.   Apply for Scholarship to fund the program or part of it.  All this is done via this centralized RMIT system.\nSo, the major first step is 3.1 which requires step 2: identify a potential supervisor and a potential topic/project.\nThe list of projects are here: https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/research-degrees/find-a-project\nNote these are some ideas of projects. As long as you find an area, topic, or problem that you are interested in, have the background needed to carry work there (e.g., math background), and is compatible with the potential supervisor, it is OK. The projects can be adapted, changed, or even added to the list!\nExpression of Interest So, if you are interested in my supervision, you must do the following to produce an EOI and eventually the full application (step 4 above):\n  First, familiarize yourself with the DR221 PhD (Computer Science) program at RMIT and make sure you meet the Entry Requirements for such program. Also be very mindful of the funding of your program, see item 7 below.\n  Then, check and study well my areas of work and my publications and find a common interest. Otherwise, you may need to look for some other staff member in the school. I do not take students working areas that I don\u0026rsquo;t have expertise and interest in.\n  Contact me to check if I am taking students at that moment. You need to tell me:\n The area/topic that you would like to pursue PhD under my supervision (e.g., path planning, reasoning about action, automated planning, agent oriented programming, goal recognition, etc) and what experience you have on them, if any. My 2-3 papers that got your attention and you would be interested in working around. Please explain what you liked about those papers and what you think can be improved or studied further. A title and one small paragraph of a problem/project you would like to work on. Some possible projects are listed on this page,but you are not limited to them at all.    If all goes well, then your next step is to then your next step is to develop a 1-2 page research proposal describing a potential research project (including aims, methodology, expected outcomes, etc).\n The purpose of this is to allow me/us to evaluate the suitability of your project, the overlap with my research, and its chance of success. The proposal must be original, that is, the product of your own work, and aligned with my areas of work and my publications. Being just a proposal, it does not have to contain technical content or amazing ideas, it is not your PhD, it is just an expression of interest for doing a PhD. However, it should not just be \u0026ldquo;hand-waving\u0026rdquo; or general concepts that cannot be trivially extracted from existing material (e.g., from my papers!). For example, writing things like: \u0026ldquo;I will develop a more powerful system that will help the agent make smarter decisions and in less time\u0026rdquo; is probably too vague and general. However, saying things like: \u0026ldquo;One limitation of the current approaches is X because R1, R2 and R2. I will investigate how to overcome such limitation by incorporating Y so that A1 and A2 happens, etc.\u0026quot; is in the right direction. The proposal will also indicate your ability to communicate effectively, so make sure it is written well and with care for detail. Remember a PhD is carried out by high-performing students after a great Honour thesis, so you are meant to show good written communication.    Once you have your proposal written, you can send it to me and I will let you know whether it is reasonable for me to be your potential supervisor in your application.\n While the proposal is part of the application, it is not a \u0026ldquo;contract\u0026rdquo; with the supervisor and you should be flexible on the topic and specific problem. Do not put down my name (or that of any other academic staff!) before following all the above steps. That will most probably significantly reduce your chances to be accepted.    Once you have the above (potential supervisor and a research proposal), you can then start your application via the RMIT submission process.\nFunding Acceptance to the PhD program does not directly mean you will be supported financially, both for tuition fees and living expenses during your program.\nYou can search the RMIT site to find the webpages for these scholarships:\nFor international students:\n  Scholarships for commencing international students  Data61 PhD Scholarship Program  International Tuition Fee Scholarships  ATN – LATAM Research Scholarships (for Latin American citizens).  COLFUTURO-RMIT University Joint Scholarship.  Endeavour Leadership Program: this covers both full PhD program but also long/short term mobility exchanges.

Data61 PhD Scholarship Program  Grants and Scholarships  Research Stipend Scholarships  Research Training Program (RTP) - (APA before) Other funding/scholarships: https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/work-study-opportunities/scholarships  When applying for the program, you should tick the box in the application on which PhD scholarships he/she wishes to apply for.\nUnfortunately, I must warn you that scholarships for international applicants are unfortunately extremely limited and difficult to obtain. :-( You need to have a top grades but may also need publications already to have some chance.\n","date":1642460400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642460400,"objectID":"4cc6f49e36cc0a2e6522da7495da17f6","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/extras/resources/phd-supervision/","publishdate":"2022-01-18T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/extras/resources/phd-supervision/","section":"extras","summary":"Overview Are you interested in applying for a PhD with our school?

Usually, at RMIT, I teach:\n  COSC1107/1105 Computing Theory (CT), 2nd year core undergrad.  COSC1125/1127 Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3rd year core undergrad.  COSC2627/2627 Discrete Structures (DS), 1st year core undergrad.  MATH2411 Mathematics for Computing 1 (MC), 1st year core undergrad.  COSC1204/2048 Agent-oriented Programming and Design (AOPD), 3rd year, elective.  COSC2780 Intelligent Decision Making (IDM), Master level, core.  What courses will you teach in 2022? This is not still decided fully but most probable I will teach MC and IDM in Semester 1, and AI in Semester 2.\nYour courses do not show up in the enrolment system, have they been discontinued? I am not in charge of the enrolment system in any way, but I am aware of courses not showing as options in students' enrolment system. This may not mean they are not available for you to take (as long as you met the pre-req or get an exemption for them).\nSo, if you the course is indeed running but you cannot see it in your enrolment system, and you think you want and can take it, please contact Enrolment at RMIT and/or your Program Manager, be Computer Science, Software Engineering or IT. There is usually a way to enrol outside the web system in those cases.\nI would like one of the pre-req to be waived (I took a similar course elsewhere), what should I do? I do not manage credits or pre-req waivers directly. You need to submit a formal request for a Requisite Waiver from Academic Services; please check here how to do so.\nOK, I have already applied formally for a waiver and they asked me to contact you to obtain approval. What should I do? Generally, the University will contact me directly if academic input is required.\nIf they ask you to contact me to get approval, you should:\n make it clear you have applied and were asked to contact me (please attach the email where you were asked to do so); and argue the case to me why you meet equivalent pre-req for the course you want to enrol in, despite not having actually taken and passed the pre-req course.  Please attach any documentation that indicates that the knowledge in that course is covered to the right level. For example, equivalent courses in other Universities or courses that include that technical material already. I am also happy to accept similar online course (e.g., Coursera) on the topic, as long as proof of completion with assessments is provided. Also programming projects (e.g., in your work or open source community) that clearly require knowledge and practice with algorithms will be considered.\nPlease note that opinions (e.g., \u0026ldquo;I know that content and have done lots of programs\u0026rdquo;) or claims without any proof (e.g., \u0026ldquo;I have taken the course X but I do not have any proof that I passed it\u0026rdquo;) are not enough evidence.\nHow difficult are your courses? This is an impossible question to answer, at least from my perspective. So take everything that I say now with care, and feel free to disregard it completely :-)\nSo, in general, I could say students find my courses not to be the easiest ones they take. However, this depends a lot on each student. So, if you are concerned or interested in the difficulty of courses, my best suggestion is that you talk to other fellow students who have taken the course under the same lecturer. Talk to many students so you get a better \u0026ldquo;sample\u0026rdquo; or talk to students who you would trust their judgement and are similar to you.\nIn general what I can say for each course is:\n Discrete Structures and Math for Computing 1 are basic maths course; the minimum to be able to be able to handle later topics in other courses. If you want CT or AI to be not to hard for you, you should probably achieve at least DI here. Computing Theory is highly theoretical, abstract, and maths based, so many students find the course difficult. Many students also find the course illuminating and deep, as it is there where you study the actual pheonomenon of our science: computation. Artificial Intelligence is also a course covering a wide spectrum of topics (almost 1 per week!), so it is intense; however it is more hands on and not so abstract as CT. The project is usually fun but requires dedication and many hours of programming and thinking. AOPD and IDM are specialised courses, so you will study a few topics but in depth. You will spend hours of work reading papers and also programming sophisticated algorithms.  Overall, then, because of the \u0026ldquo;foundational\u0026rdquo; nature of these courses, they require intense and continuous work during the whole semester, and depending on how solid your background is you may have to put additional effort and study. This means that if you are looking for an \u0026ldquo;easy course to take\u0026rdquo;, one that you can achieve a pass without significant workload in your weekly schedule, then probably none of the above are good options. However, if you are looking for an intelectual challenge and for many \u0026ldquo;aha\u0026rdquo; moments, then all four are, in my view, great options!\nHow do I enroll, when do they start, how long are the courses (etc.)? I know very little about student enrolments and I have no involvement on that, so I do not want to give wrong information. Please check here.\nRegarding other information (like how long they are, number of credit points) please refer to the course guides from the links above to each course.\nI would like to take your course but I have a clash with something else (another course, work, etc), can I still take it? In general, lectures/lectorials/workshops/tutorials are not mandatory so, technically, yes, you can take it. However, I suggest you really have a second thought about taking the course if you already know that you will be missing lectures:\n First, you will be missing a large chunk of the course, and you already know about it. Is like getting tickets for the footy season but you already know you will miss most of the games. Maybe you should get season tickets for something else then? ;-) Second, there are many useful things only said in lectures, otherwise why would they be there. So, while technically you can get everything from the books, you will be missing opportunities. Third, you will be taking a course without being part of the uni teaching \u0026ldquo;eco-system\u0026rdquo;. Yes, getting the technical content is a major part of the course, but taking a uni course also involves getting to know others, learning from fellow students, etc. In many cases, students will make friends and even potential colleagues. You will also be missing on all that too\u0026hellip;. Finally, and importantly, depending on the course, you may be missing on assessments. Sometimes courses ran assessments during those allocated times, like quizzes or class tests. This means you may be giving away marks already.  Please note that:\n You should not rely on \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; recordings 100%. They sometime fail to record, or record with quality. I cannot promise recordings will always be there or at your desired quality. So, if one class is not recorded or the recording is missing the audio, for example, you would not be able to challenge that. Assessments cannot be repeated just because you cannot attend it due to a clash. Special Consideration is about special occasions, like health or family issues, but not because you had another course or work to do. So, if you still decide to take a course that you will not attend, make 100% sure from the start you will be able to attend those lectures where important assessments will happen, like mid-term tests or oral presentations.  Again, if you already know you will not be attending the majority of the lectures, I suggest to give it another thought and see if you get better options for your education program.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t you use the University LMS online system and you use other systems (e.g., Google, EdStem, etc)? Because of 3 reasons:\n Students overwhelming (70%+) have liked those tools/plaftorms over in the years. Every course, I run polls, and very few indicate they would rather use Canvas as the main platform. They offers significantly more efficient tools for us teaching staff, which means we have more time to do other things in the course for students! Producing content in systems like Canvas takes a lot of time, which means we need to stop doing other things for the course. Finally, they provide more inclusive and richer teaching platform, which increases student engagement. Indeed, data systematically shows way more engagement from students; for example, we get many more posts when using Google Forms and EdStem than Blackboard or Canvas discussion forum (around 7x - 10x times!). Check this blog entry and this video produced by educational experts a few years ago for CT.  Note also that I have found systematically that students who express that they do not like or prefer some of the alternative platforms I use (e.g., Google or EdStem), they mostly argue in terms of \u0026ldquo;uniformity\u0026rdquo; with other courses (e.g., \u0026ldquo;I prefer all my courses in the same platform\u0026rdquo;). While I understand it may be inconvenient for some students to juggle different systems, true, I do not think this is sufficient enough argument to counter the three above. Very importantly also, I believe it is also good for students to learn how to be flexible and able to deal with different platforms and technologies at the same time, as it will surely be the case in the industry; so there is a side-effect benefit there too I think \u0026amp; hope you agree with that.\nI am not enrolled in any program and do not intent to, can I take course X? Yes, you can enrol as a single subject student, via RMIT Short courses.\nIn certain times of the year (e.g., September-November) there may not be any. However, they will be there once they open for the following year. More or less, the time of courses are published are:\n Semester 1 courses will be visible on the single courses website from start of November of the year before. Enrolment will be open to applicants on early January. Semester 2 courses will be visible on the single courses website from early May (of that year). Enrolment will be open to applicants on early June.  I am in program P and I would like to take your course X (AI/CT/AOPD) next semester as an elective subject, can I do it? Thanks for your interest in course X! Now, there are two parts to this:\n Do you have the pre-req for course X? If not, then you cannot take it. Can you fit course X into your specific program (e.g., BP094, BP096, MSC60, etc)? For that, you need to check your program structure and if not sure discuss it with the Program Manager of your program. The last thing you want is to find out that you took a course but you cannot count it towards your degree!  All the best!\nComputing Theory - COSC1105/1107 Can I take Computing Theory without having taken Discrete Structures (or equivalent)? No. It is fundamental to master basic discrete mathematics to take this course.\nI am thinking taking Computing Theory COSC1105/1107. Where can I start? Two great books are:\n Sudkamp, T. Languages and Machines: An Introduction to the Theory of Computer Science, Addison-Wesley, 3rd Edition, 2005. John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman. Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation, Addison-Wesley, 3rd Edition, 2006.  Of course, the more solid mathematical background, the better: set theory, functions, big-O notation, relations, graphs, etc. and very importantly being able to read and understand proofs, and do simple proofs.\nArtificial Intelligence - COSC1125/1127 I am interested in Machine Learning/Data Analytics, should I take your AI course? The AI COSC1125/1127 is NOT a Machine Learning course per se, and definitively NOT a data analytic course either. Machine Learning is in fact one area of Artificial Intelligence. This particular course aims at providing the foundation of AI, and as such it provides an overview of key AI subareas and problems, like search, knowledge representation, probabilistic reasoning, intelligent agents, and others, including (some) machine learning. So a large part of the course is devoted to representation and reasoning (both with and without probabilities) and control techniques.\nAs a rough indication, consider that only 1 of the 12 weeks is devoted to Machine Learning. Moreover, in recent years we have covered only the learning to act problem of Machine Learning (using reinforcement learning), rather than learning patterns in data.\nIf you are interested more in ML itself and in how ML can be used to analyse data, you may want to check this course instead.\nIf you are interested in data science, maybe check this course.\nI am thinking taking COSC1125/27 Artificial Intelligence course. What background should I have? What textbooks could I read? Basically, what is already described in its Part A: Course Overview:\n Knowledge of algorithms and their analysis, as per course COSC2123 Algorithms \u0026amp; Analysis, which is an enforced pre-req for COSC1125/27 for every program. Knowledge of programming. These days we use Python, C, and/or Java. You are expected to master programming, so you should be able to get started in another language if necessary (that is, if you know Java well, you should be able to learn Python if needed). Knowledge of discrete mathematics, such as sets, arithmetic, proof techniques (e.g., induction or contradiction), propositional and first-order logic, etc. Basically the knowledge given in COSC2627 Discrete Structures or MATH2411 Mathematics for Computing 1. A great book (available free online) is the Book of Proofs for a big part of this (no trees or graphs though).  For a good comprehensive book for the course, check AI: A Modern Approach.\nWhy is Algorithm and Analysis (A\u0026amp;A) a pre-req for AI? As you can see from the course overview, course COSC2123 Algorithms \u0026amp; Analysis is a pre-req. This is because, during the course, many AI algorithmic techniques will be seen, compared, and analysed, so it is expected that students taking the course have a good grasp of existing useful algorithms (and data structures) and ways of analysing algorithmic solutions, such as being able to obtain bounds on time and space usage of an algorithm (e.g., big-O notation).\nAlso, many of the techniques covered in the course build on generic algorithms and data-structures, such as brute-force, iterative improvement, greedy algorithms, and lists, trees, and queues. All those algorithmic and data concepts will not be covered and it is important to know (and master!) them.\nNote that it is not possible to take AI while taking A\u0026amp;A at the same time:\n The reason why A\u0026amp;A is a pre-req (and not a co-req) is that we believe students must know the content of A\u0026amp;A before they start AI. For example, already in week 1 we cover tree traversal and different complexities in big-O notation. That\u0026rsquo;s why A\u0026amp;A is a second year course, and AI is a third year course. :-) Some students enrolled in A\u0026amp;A may claim that they already know the content of A\u0026amp;A, though they are planning to take A\u0026amp;A and AI together. This appears inconsistent and may signal some problem with program planning: why are they taking a course if they already known its content? In those cases, it may be wise to talk to the corresponding Program Manager to take the best of the program. Finally, we should note that both courses AI and A\u0026amp;A are very intense and demanding, so doing them at the same time is not great.  If you think you have covered the topics of A\u0026amp;A in a previous degree or another university, you may be able to claim exception from the pre-req. See above (General section) how to do so.\nI need you to approve the waiver for the pre-req for AI You need to contact the Program Manager of your program, as he/she will be the ultimately making the decision. You need to send the Program Manager all the information required demonstrating that you have evidence to get the exception; for example that you have taken and passed a similar course to Algorithms and Analysis. The Program Manager knows the whole context within your program and he/she will then contact me for advise if needed. This also reduces the chances of misunderstandings, errors, and contradictions caused by different email threads with different people.\nWill AI be offered in Semester 1? In the past it was offered in Semester 1, but with some changes in programs the course was moved to Semester 2. As far as I can tell, there are no current plans to run it in Semester 1. Of course, things change and I am not the one who decides when a course runs, but at this point the course runs in Semester 2.\nIs the AI practical or theoretically oriented? Both. This course has both significant programming as well as significant theoretical content. During the course you will need to program standard AI algorithms (like A*, alpha-beta pruning, RL, or even code in Prolog programming language), but you will also have to calculate conditional probabilities using a Bayesian Network, understand the computational complexity of search algorithms (why is A* exponential in the worst case?), and even be able to mathematically prove why A* algorithm with an admissible heuristic will output an optimal solution. Note these examples are nor pre-req, the course will cover them, but we would expect students to be able to do achieve those tasks. To do so, you need programming and SE skills as well as mathematical and algorithmic backgrounds. That\u0026rsquo;s why the pre-reqs\u0026hellip; ;-)\nWhat programming languages is used in the AI course? It depends on each edition, but since 2017 we have used Python. Before that, we have used C and some Java. Nonetheless, at this stage of the program, students are supposed to be proficient and flexible at programming. For example, many students had their first encounter with Python in this AI course, and they learnt it as part of the course, no problem.\nThe fact is that while being already proficient at the language used may provide benefits and speed up things, the course will not require extremely advanced features and techniques of a particular language that you cannot pick them up during the course itself.\nThere is indeed significant programming work in the course and we expect students, at this stage, to know how to program beyond basic programming.\nI am not enrolled in any program and do not intent to, can I take the AI course? See question \u0026ldquo;*I am not enrolled in any program and do not intent to, can I take course X? *\u0026rdquo; above under General.\nWhat is the syllabus of the course, what topics will be covered? We disclose the exact details of the course in Part B of the Course Overview.

Those plans are generally meant to be executed by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, unmanned vehicles, or complex embedded systems.\nI am particularly interested in advanced forms of planning (e.g., such as planning under non-determinism or adaptive planning), the link with controller synthesis for adversarial planning, and path-planning (or pathfinding) in an AI context.\nTogether with students, and sometimes as part of the COSC1024/2048 Agent-Oriented Programming course, we developed path-planning libraries and simulation-visualisation toolkit (that are compatible with Moving-AI benchmark framework).\nSome representative papers in the area are:\n  Ivan D.

These programs can typically be useful to program robotic or software agents with higher level cognitive functions that involve reasoning, for example, about goals, perception, actions, the mental states of other agents, collaborative task execution, etc.\nI am interested in mainly two type of agent systems, namely, Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) event-driven systems (like SARL, JACK, or JASON) and GOLOG-type systems built on top of the famous situation calculus logical framework (like IndiGolog, a high-level programming language where programs are executed incrementally to allow for interleaved action, planning, sensing, and exogenous events).\nSome relevant papers are:\n Max Waters, Lin Padgham, and Sebastian Sardina.

A complex surveillance system for a smart house can be then “realised” (i.e., implemented) by suitably coordinating the behaviours (i.e., the operational logic) of hundreds (or thousands) of simple devices and artifacts (e.g., lights, blinds, a microwave, a vacuum cleaner, video cameras, a floor cleaning robot, etc.) installed in the house. The problem then is how to automatically build an embedded controller-coordinator to bring about a desired target complex system by suitably coordinating the available components.\nBehavior composition is not restricted to smart environments and can also be applied to build complex systems in advanced manufacturing systems, web-services, or even in video games, for story generation.\nA short (fairly easy to read) overview paper on the topic and a more in-depth journal article on the topic are:\n  Giuseppe De Giacomo, Fabio Patrizi, and Sebastian Sardina.

We have worked on how to make recognition faster and more robust to irrational/erratic observed behavior.

Probabilistic goal recognition systems, however, explicitly depend on some degree of sub-optimality to generate probability distributions. We show that, even when an observed agent is only slightly irrational (sub-optimal), state-of-the-art systems produce counter-intuitive results (though these may only become noticeable when the agent is highly irrational). We provide a definition of rationality appropriate to situations where the ground truth is unknown, define a rationality measure (RM) that quantifies an agent's expected degree of sub-optimality, and define an innovative self-modulating probability distribution formula for goal recognition. Our formula recognises sub-optimality and adjusts its level of confidence accordingly, thereby handling irrationality—and rationality—in an intuitive, principled manner. Building on that formula, moreover, we strengthen a previously published result, showing that “single-observation” recognition in the path-planning domain achieves identical results to more computationally expensive techniques, where previously we claimed only to achieve equivalent rankings though values differed.","tags":["planning","goal_recognition","ssardina","ssardina-core"],"title":"Expecting the unexpected: Goal recognition for rational and irrational agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan D.

The fairness assumptions are of the form A/B and say that state trajectories that contain infinite occurrences of an action a from A in a state s and finite occurrence of actions from B, must also contain infinite occurrences of action a in s followed by each one of its possible outcomes. The infinite trajectories that violate this condition are deemed as unfair, and the solutions are policies for which all the fair trajectories reach a goal state. We show that strong and strong-cyclic FOND planning, as well as QNP planning, a planning model introduced recently for generalized planning, are all special cases of FOND planning with fairness assumptions of this form which can also be combined. FOND+ planning, as this form of planning is called, combines the syntax of FOND planning with some of the versatility of LTL for expressing fairness constraints. A new planner is implemented by reducing FOND+ planning to answer set programs, and the performance of the planner is evaluated in comparison with FOND and QNP planners, and LTL synthesis tools.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","automated_planning","fond","asp"],"title":"Flexible FOND Planning with Explicit Fairness Assumptions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Building on this, we demonstrate (3) that a Radius of Maximum Probability (i.e., the distance from a goal within which that goal is guaranteed to be the most probable) can be calculated from relative cost-distances between the candidate goals and a start location, without needing to calculate any actual probabilities.

Agent planning programs are finite-state programs, possibly containing loops, whose atomic instructions consist of a guard, a maintenance goal, and an achievement goal, which act as precondition-invariance-postcondition assertions in program specification. Such programs are to be executed in possibly nondeterministic planning domains and their execution requires generating plans that meet the goals specified in the atomic instructions, while respecting the program control flow. In this paper, we define the problem of automatically synthesizing the required plans to execute an agent planning program, propose a solution technique based on model checking of two-player game structures, and use it to characterize the worst-case computational complexity of the problem as EXPTIME-complete. Then, we consider the case of deterministic domains and propose a different technique to solve agent planning programs, which is based on iteratively solving classical planning problems and on exploiting goal preferences and plan adaptation methods. Finally, we study the effectiveness of this approach for deterministic domains through an experimental analysis on well-known planning domains.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","automated_planning","agent_programming","synthesis"],"title":"Agent Planning Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Max Waters","Lin Padgham","Sebastian Sardina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642247391,"objectID":"8b746ac99fdb9e08b054b5da9b6e5fb6","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/publication/waters-padgham-sardina-jaamas-15/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T11:50:24.788711Z","relpermalink":"/publication/waters-padgham-sardina-jaamas-15/","section":"publication","summary":"The Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agent paradigm provides a powerful basis for developing complex systems based on autonomous intelligent agents. These agents have, at any point in time, a set of intentions encoding the various tasks the agent is working on. Despite its importance, the problem of selecting which intention to progress at any point in time has received almost no attention and has been mostly left to the programmer to resolve in an application-dependent manner. In this paper, we implement and evaluate two domain-independent intention selection mechanisms based on the ideas of enablement checking and low coverage prioritisation. Through a battery of automatically generated synthetic tests and one real program, we compare these with the commonly used intention selection mechanisms of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Round Robin (RR). We found that enablement checking, which is incorporated into low coverage prioritisation, is never detrimental and provides substantial benefits when running vulnerable programs in dynamic environments. This is a significant finding as such a check can be readily applied to FIFO and RR, giving an extremely simple and effective mechanism to be added to existing BDI frameworks. In turn, low coverage prioritisation provides a significant further benefit.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","bdi","agent_programming"],"title":"Improving Domain-Independent Intention Selection in BDI Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe De Giacomo","Fabio Patrizi","Sebastian Sardina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642247391,"objectID":"da354cc009702913f7ef9693f7ef48eb","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/publication/de-giacomo-patrizi-sardina-aij-13/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T11:50:24.869388Z","relpermalink":"/publication/de-giacomo-patrizi-sardina-aij-13/","section":"publication","summary":"The behavior composition problem amounts to realizing a virtual desired module (e.g., a surveillance agent system) by suitably coordinating (and re-purposing) the execution of a set of available modules (e.g., a video camera, vacuum cleaner, a robot, etc.).

Both behaviors and environment are represented as arbitrary finite state transition systems. The technique we propose is directly based on the idea that the controller job is to coordinate the concurrent execution of the available behaviors so as to “mimic” the target behavior. To this end, we exploit a variant of the formal notion of simulation to formally capture the notion of “mimicking”, and we show that the technique proposed is sound and complete, optimal with respect to computational complexity, and robust for different kind of system failures. In addition, we demonstrate that the technique is well suited for highly efficient implementation based on synthesis by model checking technologies, by relating the problem to that of finding a winning strategy in a special safety game and explaining how to actually solve it using an existing verification tool.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","composition","synthesis","rac"],"title":"Automatic Behavior Composition Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nitin Yadav","Sebastian Sardina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1346457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642247391,"objectID":"cbff42c6fe8ea929064bd39dc5bdf448","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/publication/yadav-sardina-jelia-12-b/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T11:50:24.951395Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yadav-sardina-jelia-12-b/","section":"publication","summary":"The behavior composition problem involves automatically building a controller that is able to realize a desired, but unavailable, target system (e.g., a house surveillance) by suitably coordinating a set of available components (e.g., video cameras, blinds, lamps, a vacuum cleaner, phones, etc.) Previous work has almost exclusively aimed at bringing about the desired component in its totality, which is highly unsatisfactory for unsolvable problems.

The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent paradigm has proven to be one of the major approaches to intelligent agent systems, both in academia and in industry. Typical BDI agent-oriented programming languages rely on user-provided “plan libraries” to achieve goals, and online context sensitive subgoal selection and expansion. These allow for the development of systems that are extremely flexible and responsive to the environment, and as a result, well suited for complex applications with (soft) real-time reasoning and control requirements. Nonetheless, complex decision making that goes beyond, but is compatible with, run-time context-dependent plan selection is one of the most natural and important next steps within this technology. In this paper we develop a typical BDI-style agent-oriented programming language that enhances usual BDI programming style with three distinguished features: declarative goals, look-ahead planning, and failure handling. First, an account that mixes both procedural and declarative aspects of goals is necessary in order to reason about important properties of goals and to decouple plans from what these plans are meant to achieve. Second, lookahead deliberation about the effects of one choice of expansion over another is clearly desirable or even mandatory in many circumstances so as to guarantee goal achievability and to avoid undesired situations. Finally, a failure handling mechanism, suitably integrated with both declarative goals and planning, is required in order to model an adequate level of commitment to goals, as well as to be consistent with most real BDI implemented systems.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","agent_programming","BDI"],"title":"A BDI Agent Programming Language with Failure Recovery, Declarative Goals, and Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe De Giacomo","Yves Lespérance","Hector J.

The IndiGolog interpreter then reasons about the preconditions and effects of the actions in the program to a legal terminating execution. To support this, the programmer provides a declarative specication of the domain (i.e., primitive actions, preconditions and effects, what is known about the initial state) in the situation calculus. The programmer can control the amount of non-determinism in the program and how much of it is searched over. The language is rich and supports concurrent programming.

He completed his PhD and M.Sc at the University of Toronto (Canada) and, before that, a BSc in Computer Science at South National University in Bahia Blanca (Argentina).\nSebastian\u0026rsquo;s research falls in the intersection between knowledge representation, AI planning, and intelligent agents. His research seeks better representation models and algorithms for programming goal-oriented controllers operating in dynamic environments. Together with his many collaborators and students (for which he feels extremely lucky and grateful!), he has contributed significantly to the integration of agent programming languages with planning and learning capabilities, the study and development of advanced forms of planning, and the development of goal/intention recognition techniques for intelligent agents. His work appears regularly in the main AI scientific publication outlets, such as IJCAI, AAAI, AIJ, JAIR, AAMAS, ICAPS and KR, and many of his papers have received paper awards or nominations.\nSebastian\u0026rsquo;s teaching has focused on course related to the mathematical foundations of Computer Science. He has also been involved in bringing Computational Thinking to the community, particularly to children and youth, by delivering hands-on workshops and talks to students and educators. He has recently been part of the panel at VCAA conducting the study design review for the new Algorithmics (HESS) VCE program.\nAn an even shorter one!
