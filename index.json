At RMIT I teach courses mostly related to the mathematical foundations of Computer Science, such as Theory of Computation, Discrete Mathematics, and Artificial Intelligence.\nI am also very interested in bringing Computational Thinking to the community, particularly to children and youth.

Those plans are generally meant to be executed by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, unmanned vehicles, or complex embedded systems.\nI am particularly interested in advanced forms of planning (e.g., such as planning under non-determinism or adaptive planning), the link with controller synthesis for adversarial planning, and path-planning (or pathfinding) in an AI context.\nTogether with students, and sometimes as part of the COSC1024/2048 Agent-Oriented Programming course, we developed path-planning libraries and simulation-visualisation toolkit (that are compatible with Moving-AI benchmark framework).\nSome representative papers in the area are:\n  Ivan D.

High-level agent-oriented programming can be seen as a middle ground between automated planning and full standard programming (e.g., Java). The idea is to write programs in a loose language so that programs will contain \u0026ldquo;gaps\u0026rdquo; that need to be filled out at execution time. These programs can typically be useful to program robotic or software agents with higher level cognitive functions that involve reasoning, for example, about goals, perception, actions, the mental states of other agents, collaborative task execution, etc.\nI am interested in mainly two type of agent systems, namely, Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) event-driven systems (like SARL, JACK, or JASON) and GOLOG-type systems built on top of the famous situation calculus logical framework (like IndiGolog, a high-level programming language where programs are executed incrementally to allow for interleaved action, planning, sensing, and exogenous events).\nSome relevant papers are:\n Max Waters, Lin Padgham, and Sebastian Sardina.

A complex surveillance system for a smart house can be then “realised” (i.e., implemented) by suitably coordinating the behaviours (i.e., the operational logic) of hundreds (or thousands) of simple devices and artifacts (e.g., lights, blinds, a microwave, a vacuum cleaner, video cameras, a floor cleaning robot, etc.) installed in the house. The problem then is how to automatically build an embedded controller-coordinator to bring about a desired target complex system by suitably coordinating the available components.\nBehavior composition is not restricted to smart environments and can also be applied to build complex systems in advanced manufacturing systems, web-services, or even in video games, for story generation.\nA short (fairly easy to read) overview paper on the topic and a more in-depth journal article on the topic are:\n  Giuseppe De Giacomo, Fabio Patrizi, and Sebastian Sardina.

Traditionally, the problem has involved matching a sequence of observations to a plan in a pre-defined plan library; the winning plan being the one that \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; matches the observations.\nRecent developments dispense with the overhead of a plan library and instead\u0026mdash;based on the assumption that the observed agent is behaving rationally\u0026mdash;take a cost-based approach and uses classical planning technology to generate candidate plans as needed over a domain model.\nIn a series of work, we have extended and improved the cost-based approach to goal recognition, both for general task planning and path planning. We have worked on how to make recognition faster and more robust to irrational/erratic observed behavior. We have also looked at its' dual problem: deceptive behavior, the problem of generating behavior that is as deceptive as possible, while still achieving the intended objective.\nSome representative papers are:\n Peta Masters, Sebastian Sardiña: Expecting the unexpected: Goal recognition for rational and irrational agents.

Probabilistic goal recognition systems, however, explicitly depend on some degree of sub-optimality to generate probability distributions. We show that, even when an observed agent is only slightly irrational (sub-optimal), state-of-the-art systems produce counter-intuitive results (though these may only become noticeable when the agent is highly irrational). We provide a definition of rationality appropriate to situations where the ground truth is unknown, define a rationality measure (RM) that quantifies an agent's expected degree of sub-optimality, and define an innovative self-modulating probability distribution formula for goal recognition. Our formula recognises sub-optimality and adjusts its level of confidence accordingly, thereby handling irrationality—and rationality—in an intuitive, principled manner. Building on that formula, moreover, we strengthen a previously published result, showing that “single-observation” recognition in the path-planning domain achieves identical results to more computationally expensive techniques, where previously we claimed only to achieve equivalent rankings though values differed.","tags":["planning","goal_recognition","ssardina","ssardina-core"],"title":"Expecting the unexpected: Goal recognition for rational and irrational agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan D.

The fairness assumptions are of the form A/B and say that state trajectories that contain infinite occurrences of an action a from A in a state s and finite occurrence of actions from B, must also contain infinite occurrences of action a in s followed by each one of its possible outcomes. The infinite trajectories that violate this condition are deemed as unfair, and the solutions are policies for which all the fair trajectories reach a goal state. We show that strong and strong-cyclic FOND planning, as well as QNP planning, a planning model introduced recently for generalized planning, are all special cases of FOND planning with fairness assumptions of this form which can also be combined. FOND+ planning, as this form of planning is called, combines the syntax of FOND planning with some of the versatility of LTL for expressing fairness constraints. A new planner is implemented by reducing FOND+ planning to answer set programs, and the performance of the planner is evaluated in comparison with FOND and QNP planners, and LTL synthesis tools.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","automated_planning","fond","asp"],"title":"Flexible FOND Planning with Explicit Fairness Assumptions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Contemporary solutions for general task-planning relate the probability of a goal to the cost of reaching it. We adapt this approach to goal recognition in the strict context of path-planning. We show (1) that a simpler formula provides an identical result to current state-of-the-art in less than half the time under all but one set of conditions. Further, we prove (2) that the probability distribution based on this technique is independent of an agent's past behaviour and present a revised formula that achieves goal recognition by reference to the agent's starting point and current location only. Building on this, we demonstrate (3) that a Radius of Maximum Probability (i.e., the distance from a goal within which that goal is guaranteed to be the most probable) can be calculated from relative cost-distances between the candidate goals and a start location, without needing to calculate any actual probabilities. In this extended version of earlier work, we generalise our framework to the continuous domain and discuss our results, including the conditions under which our findings can be generalised back to goal recognition in general task-planning.","tags":["goal_recognition agents","ssardina","ssardina-core","automated_planning"],"title":"Cost-Based Goal Recognition in Navigational Domains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas D'Ippolito","Natalia Rodriguez","Sebastian Sardina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642247390,"objectID":"4392b040a417092aa448ca52ba0a2597","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/publication/dippolito-rodriguez-sardina-jair-18/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T11:50:24.623864Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dippolito-rodriguez-sardina-jair-18/","section":"publication","summary":"We contribute to recent efforts in relating two approaches to automatic synthesis, namely, automated planning and discrete reactive synthesis.

Agent planning programs are finite-state programs, possibly containing loops, whose atomic instructions consist of a guard, a maintenance goal, and an achievement goal, which act as precondition-invariance-postcondition assertions in program specification. Such programs are to be executed in possibly nondeterministic planning domains and their execution requires generating plans that meet the goals specified in the atomic instructions, while respecting the program control flow. In this paper, we define the problem of automatically synthesizing the required plans to execute an agent planning program, propose a solution technique based on model checking of two-player game structures, and use it to characterize the worst-case computational complexity of the problem as EXPTIME-complete. Then, we consider the case of deterministic domains and propose a different technique to solve agent planning programs, which is based on iteratively solving classical planning problems and on exploiting goal preferences and plan adaptation methods. Finally, we study the effectiveness of this approach for deterministic domains through an experimental analysis on well-known planning domains.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","automated_planning","agent_programming","synthesis"],"title":"Agent Planning Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Max Waters","Lin Padgham","Sebastian Sardina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642247391,"objectID":"8b746ac99fdb9e08b054b5da9b6e5fb6","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/publication/waters-padgham-sardina-jaamas-15/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T11:50:24.788711Z","relpermalink":"/publication/waters-padgham-sardina-jaamas-15/","section":"publication","summary":"The Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agent paradigm provides a powerful basis for developing complex systems based on autonomous intelligent agents. These agents have, at any point in time, a set of intentions encoding the various tasks the agent is working on. Despite its importance, the problem of selecting which intention to progress at any point in time has received almost no attention and has been mostly left to the programmer to resolve in an application-dependent manner. In this paper, we implement and evaluate two domain-independent intention selection mechanisms based on the ideas of enablement checking and low coverage prioritisation. Through a battery of automatically generated synthetic tests and one real program, we compare these with the commonly used intention selection mechanisms of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Round Robin (RR). We found that enablement checking, which is incorporated into low coverage prioritisation, is never detrimental and provides substantial benefits when running vulnerable programs in dynamic environments. This is a significant finding as such a check can be readily applied to FIFO and RR, giving an extremely simple and effective mechanism to be added to existing BDI frameworks. In turn, low coverage prioritisation provides a significant further benefit.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","bdi","agent_programming"],"title":"Improving Domain-Independent Intention Selection in BDI Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe De Giacomo","Fabio Patrizi","Sebastian Sardina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642247391,"objectID":"da354cc009702913f7ef9693f7ef48eb","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/publication/de-giacomo-patrizi-sardina-aij-13/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T11:50:24.869388Z","relpermalink":"/publication/de-giacomo-patrizi-sardina-aij-13/","section":"publication","summary":"The behavior composition problem amounts to realizing a virtual desired module (e.g., a surveillance agent system) by suitably coordinating (and re-purposing) the execution of a set of available modules (e.g., a video camera, vacuum cleaner, a robot, etc.).

Both behaviors and environment are represented as arbitrary finite state transition systems. The technique we propose is directly based on the idea that the controller job is to coordinate the concurrent execution of the available behaviors so as to “mimic” the target behavior. To this end, we exploit a variant of the formal notion of simulation to formally capture the notion of “mimicking”, and we show that the technique proposed is sound and complete, optimal with respect to computational complexity, and robust for different kind of system failures. In addition, we demonstrate that the technique is well suited for highly efficient implementation based on synthesis by model checking technologies, by relating the problem to that of finding a winning strategy in a special safety game and explaining how to actually solve it using an existing verification tool.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","composition","synthesis","rac"],"title":"Automatic Behavior Composition Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nitin Yadav","Sebastian Sardina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1346457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642247391,"objectID":"cbff42c6fe8ea929064bd39dc5bdf448","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/publication/yadav-sardina-jelia-12-b/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T11:50:24.951395Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yadav-sardina-jelia-12-b/","section":"publication","summary":"The behavior composition problem involves automatically building a controller that is able to realize a desired, but unavailable, target system (e.g., a house surveillance) by suitably coordinating a set of available components (e.g., video cameras, blinds, lamps, a vacuum cleaner, phones, etc.) Previous work has almost exclusively aimed at bringing about the desired component in its totality, which is highly unsatisfactory for unsolvable problems. In this work, we develop an approach for approximate behavior composition without departing from the classical setting, thus making the problem applicable to a much wider range of cases.

The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent paradigm has proven to be one of the major approaches to intelligent agent systems, both in academia and in industry. Typical BDI agent-oriented programming languages rely on user-provided “plan libraries” to achieve goals, and online context sensitive subgoal selection and expansion. These allow for the development of systems that are extremely flexible and responsive to the environment, and as a result, well suited for complex applications with (soft) real-time reasoning and control requirements. Nonetheless, complex decision making that goes beyond, but is compatible with, run-time context-dependent plan selection is one of the most natural and important next steps within this technology. In this paper we develop a typical BDI-style agent-oriented programming language that enhances usual BDI programming style with three distinguished features: declarative goals, look-ahead planning, and failure handling. First, an account that mixes both procedural and declarative aspects of goals is necessary in order to reason about important properties of goals and to decouple plans from what these plans are meant to achieve. Second, lookahead deliberation about the effects of one choice of expansion over another is clearly desirable or even mandatory in many circumstances so as to guarantee goal achievability and to avoid undesired situations. Finally, a failure handling mechanism, suitably integrated with both declarative goals and planning, is required in order to model an adequate level of commitment to goals, as well as to be consistent with most real BDI implemented systems.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","agent_programming","BDI"],"title":"A BDI Agent Programming Language with Failure Recovery, Declarative Goals, and Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giuseppe De Giacomo","Yves Lespérance","Hector J.

Instead of classical planning, it supports high-level program execution. The programmer provides a high-level  non-deterministic program involving domain-specific actions and tests to perform the agent’s tasks. The IndiGolog interpreter then reasons about the preconditions and effects of the actions in the program to a legal terminating execution. To support this, the programmer provides a declarative specication of the domain (i.e., primitive actions, preconditions and effects, what is known about the initial state) in the situation calculus. The programmer can control the amount of non-determinism in the program and how much of it is searched over. The language is rich and supports concurrent programming. Programs are executed online together with sensing the environment and monitoring for events, thus supporting the development of reactive agents.

We show that this view of planning is fundamentally limited. Any plan that is successful by this criteria has an upper bound on the number of actions it can execute. Specifically, the account will not work when iterative plans are needed. We also show that by modifying the definition slightly, we obtain another account of planning that does work properly even for iterative plans.

I completed my PhD and M.Sc in the Cognitive Robotics Group at the University of Toronto (Canada) under the supervision of Prof. Hector Levesque. Before that, I completed a Bachelor in Computer Science at Universidad Nacional del Sur (South National University) in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, with a thesis under the advise of Prof. Guillermo Simari. I have held Visiting Professor/Research positions at Universidad Nacional del Sur and Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina), Sapienza Universita’ di Roma and Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, Bolzan (Italy), the Universidad Católica de Chile (Chile), and at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain).\nMy research falls in the intersection between knowledge representation for reasoning about dynamic systems, AI automated planning, and agent-oriented programming. In a nutshell, my research seeks better representation models and algorithms for programming intelligent controllers operating in complex and dynamic environments, in which an agent must plan, verify, execute, monitor, and reconsider its actions so as to achieve its goals. Developing such controllers in standard programming languages (like C++, Python, or JAVA) becomes a difficult, cumbersome, and an error-prone task, so we look for better ways to do that! My work is regularly published at AI scientific venues like IJCAI, AAAI, AIJ, JAIR, AAMAS, ICAPS and KR, but I have also published in non-AI outlets like IEEE SOCA, BPM, CIG, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, and Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems. In my research, I have extensively collaborated with many academics in research, most notably with Prof. Giuseppe De Giacomo and his group at Sapienza Universita' di Roma, Italy.\nIn terms of teaching, I have taught at RMIT courses that are mostly related to the mathematical foundations of Computer Science, such as Theory of Computation, Discrete Mathematics, and Artificial Intelligence. I have also taught two seminar research style courses, namely, COSC1204/2048 Agent-oriented Programming \u0026amp; Design and COSC2780 Intelligent Decision Making.

Usually, at RMIT, I teach:\n  COSC1107/1105 Computing Theory (CT), 2nd year core undergrad.  COSC1125/1127 Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3rd year core undergrad.  COSC2627/2627 Discrete Structures (DS), 1st year core undergrad.  MATH2411 Mathematics for Computing 1 (MC), 1st year core undergrad.

This is not still decided fully but most probable I will teach MC and IDM in Semester 1, and AI in Semester 2.\nYour courses do not show up in the enrolment system, have they been discontinued? I am not in charge of the enrolment system in any way, but I am aware of courses not showing as options in students' enrolment system. This may not mean they are not available for you to take (as long as you met the pre-req or get an exemption for them).\nSo, if you the course is indeed running but you cannot see it in your enrolment system, and you think you want and can take it, please contact Enrolment at RMIT and/or your Program Manager, be Computer Science, Software Engineering or IT. There is usually a way to enrol outside the web system in those cases.\nI would like one of the pre-req to be waived (I took a similar course elsewhere), what should I do? I do not manage credits or pre-req waivers directly. You need to submit a formal request for a Requisite Waiver from Academic Services; please check here how to do so.\nOK, I have already applied formally for a waiver and they asked me to contact you to obtain approval. What should I do? Generally, the University will contact me directly if academic input is required.\nIf they ask you to contact me to get approval, you should:\n make it clear you have applied and were asked to contact me (please attach the email where you were asked to do so); and argue the case to me why you meet equivalent pre-req for the course you want to enrol in, despite not having actually taken and passed the pre-req course.  Please attach any documentation that indicates that the knowledge in that course is covered to the right level. For example, equivalent courses in other Universities or courses that include that technical material already. I am also happy to accept similar online course (e.g., Coursera) on the topic, as long as proof of completion with assessments is provided. Also programming projects (e.g., in your work or open source community) that clearly require knowledge and practice with algorithms will be considered.\nPlease note that opinions (e.g., \u0026ldquo;I know that content and have done lots of programs\u0026rdquo;) or claims without any proof (e.g., \u0026ldquo;I have taken the course X but I do not have any proof that I passed it\u0026rdquo;) are not enough evidence.\nHow difficult are your courses? This is an impossible question to answer, at least from my perspective. So take everything that I say now with care, and feel free to disregard it completely :-)\nSo, in general, I could say students find my courses not to be the easiest ones they take. However, this depends a lot on each student. So, if you are concerned or interested in the difficulty of courses, my best suggestion is that you talk to other fellow students who have taken the course under the same lecturer. Talk to many students so you get a better \u0026ldquo;sample\u0026rdquo; or talk to students who you would trust their judgement and are similar to you.\nIn general what I can say for each course is:\n Discrete Structures and Math for Computing 1 are basic maths course; the minimum to be able to be able to handle later topics in other courses. If you want CT or AI to be not to hard for you, you should probably achieve at least DI here. Computing Theory is highly theoretical, abstract, and maths based, so many students find the course difficult. Many students also find the course illuminating and deep, as it is there where you study the actual pheonomenon of our science: computation. Artificial Intelligence is also a course covering a wide spectrum of topics (almost 1 per week!), so it is intense; however it is more hands on and not so abstract as CT. The project is usually fun but requires dedication and many hours of programming and thinking. AOPD and IDM are specialised courses, so you will study a few topics but in depth. You will spend hours of work reading papers and also programming sophisticated algorithms.  Overall, then, because of the \u0026ldquo;foundational\u0026rdquo; nature of these courses, they require intense and continuous work during the whole semester, and depending on how solid your background is you may have to put additional effort and study. This means that if you are looking for an \u0026ldquo;easy course to take\u0026rdquo;, one that you can achieve a pass without significant workload in your weekly schedule, then probably none of the above are good options. However, if you are looking for an intelectual challenge and for many \u0026ldquo;aha\u0026rdquo; moments, then all four are, in my view, great options!\nHow do I enroll, when do they start, how long are the courses (etc.)? I know very little about student enrolments and I have no involvement on that, so I do not want to give wrong information. Please check here.\nRegarding other information (like how long they are, number of credit points) please refer to the course guides from the links above to each course.\nI would like to take your course but I have a clash with something else (another course, work, etc), can I still take it? In general, lectures/lectorials/workshops/tutorials are not mandatory so, technically, yes, you can take it. However, I suggest you really have a second thought about taking the course if you already know that you will be missing lectures:\n First, you will be missing a large chunk of the course, and you already know about it. Is like getting tickets for the footy season but you already know you will miss most of the games. Maybe you should get season tickets for something else then? ;-) Second, there are many useful things only said in lectures, otherwise why would they be there. So, while technically you can get everything from the books, you will be missing opportunities. Third, you will be taking a course without being part of the uni teaching \u0026ldquo;eco-system\u0026rdquo;. Yes, getting the technical content is a major part of the course, but taking a uni course also involves getting to know others, learning from fellow students, etc. In many cases, students will make friends and even potential colleagues. You will also be missing on all that too\u0026hellip;. Finally, and importantly, depending on the course, you may be missing on assessments. Sometimes courses ran assessments during those allocated times, like quizzes or class tests. This means you may be giving away marks already.  Please note that:\n You should not rely on \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; recordings 100%. They sometime fail to record, or record with quality. I cannot promise recordings will always be there or at your desired quality. So, if one class is not recorded or the recording is missing the audio, for example, you would not be able to challenge that. Assessments cannot be repeated just because you cannot attend it due to a clash. Special Consideration is about special occasions, like health or family issues, but not because you had another course or work to do. So, if you still decide to take a course that you will not attend, make 100% sure from the start you will be able to attend those lectures where important assessments will happen, like mid-term tests or oral presentations.  Again, if you already know you will not be attending the majority of the lectures, I suggest to give it another thought and see if you get better options for your education program.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t you use the University LMS online system and you use other systems (e.g., Google, EdStem, etc)? Because of 3 reasons:\n Students overwhelming (70%+) have liked those tools/plaftorms over in the years. Every course, I run polls, and very few indicate they would rather use Canvas as the main platform. They offers significantly more efficient tools for us teaching staff, which means we have more time to do other things in the course for students! Producing content in systems like Canvas takes a lot of time, which means we need to stop doing other things for the course. Finally, they provide more inclusive and richer teaching platform, which increases student engagement. Indeed, data systematically shows way more engagement from students; for example, we get many more posts when using Google Forms and EdStem than Blackboard or Canvas discussion forum (around 7x - 10x times!). Check this blog entry and this video produced by educational experts a few years ago for CT.  Note also that I have found systematically that students who express that they do not like or prefer some of the alternative platforms I use (e.g., Google or EdStem), they mostly argue in terms of \u0026ldquo;uniformity\u0026rdquo; with other courses (e.g., \u0026ldquo;I prefer all my courses in the same platform\u0026rdquo;). While I understand it may be inconvenient for some students to juggle different systems, true, I do not think this is sufficient enough argument to counter the three above. Very importantly also, I believe it is also good for students to learn how to be flexible and able to deal with different platforms and technologies at the same time, as it will surely be the case in the industry; so there is a side-effect benefit there too I think \u0026amp; hope you agree with that.\nI am not enrolled in any program and do not intent to, can I take course X? Yes, you can enrol as a single subject student, via RMIT Short courses.\nIn certain times of the year (e.g., September-November) there may not be any. However, they will be there once they open for the following year. More or less, the time of courses are published are:\n Semester 1 courses will be visible on the single courses website from start of November of the year before. Enrolment will be open to applicants on early January. Semester 2 courses will be visible on the single courses website from early May (of that year). Enrolment will be open to applicants on early June.  I am in program P and I would like to take your course X (AI/CT/AOPD) next semester as an elective subject, can I do it? Thanks for your interest in course X! Now, there are two parts to this:\n Do you have the pre-req for course X? If not, then you cannot take it. Can you fit course X into your specific program (e.g., BP094, BP096, MSC60, etc)? For that, you need to check your program structure and if not sure discuss it with the Program Manager of your program. The last thing you want is to find out that you took a course but you cannot count it towards your degree!  All the best!\nComputing Theory - COSC1105/1107 Can I take Computing Theory without having taken Discrete Structures (or equivalent)? No. It is fundamental to master basic discrete mathematics to take this course.\nI am thinking taking Computing Theory COSC1105/1107. Where can I start? Two great books are:\n Sudkamp, T. Languages and Machines: An Introduction to the Theory of Computer Science, Addison-Wesley, 3rd Edition, 2005. John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman. Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation, Addison-Wesley, 3rd Edition, 2006.  Of course, the more solid mathematical background, the better: set theory, functions, big-O notation, relations, graphs, etc. and very importantly being able to read and understand proofs, and do simple proofs.\nArtificial Intelligence - COSC1125/1127 I am interested in Machine Learning/Data Analytics, should I take your AI course? The AI COSC1125/1127 is NOT a Machine Learning course per se, and definitively NOT a data analytic course either. Machine Learning is in fact one area of Artificial Intelligence. This particular course aims at providing the foundation of AI, and as such it provides an overview of key AI subareas and problems, like search, knowledge representation, probabilistic reasoning, intelligent agents, and others, including (some) machine learning. So a large part of the course is devoted to representation and reasoning (both with and without probabilities) and control techniques.\nAs a rough indication, consider that only 1 of the 12 weeks is devoted to Machine Learning. Moreover, in recent years we have covered only the learning to act problem of Machine Learning (using reinforcement learning), rather than learning patterns in data.\nIf you are interested more in ML itself and in how ML can be used to analyse data, you may want to check this course instead.\nIf you are interested in data science, maybe check this course.\nI am thinking taking COSC1125/27 Artificial Intelligence course. What background should I have? What textbooks could I read? Basically, what is already described in its Part A: Course Overview:\n Knowledge of algorithms and their analysis, as per course COSC2123 Algorithms \u0026amp; Analysis, which is an enforced pre-req for COSC1125/27 for every program. Knowledge of programming. These days we use Python, C, and/or Java. You are expected to master programming, so you should be able to get started in another language if necessary (that is, if you know Java well, you should be able to learn Python if needed). Knowledge of discrete mathematics, such as sets, arithmetic, proof techniques (e.g., induction or contradiction), propositional and first-order logic, etc. Basically the knowledge given in COSC2627 Discrete Structures or MATH2411 Mathematics for Computing 1. A great book (available free online) is the Book of Proofs for a big part of this (no trees or graphs though).  For a good comprehensive book for the course, check AI: A Modern Approach.\nWhy is Algorithm and Analysis (A\u0026amp;A) a pre-req for AI? As you can see from the course overview, course COSC2123 Algorithms \u0026amp; Analysis is a pre-req. This is because, during the course, many AI algorithmic techniques will be seen, compared, and analysed, so it is expected that students taking the course have a good grasp of existing useful algorithms (and data structures) and ways of analysing algorithmic solutions, such as being able to obtain bounds on time and space usage of an algorithm (e.g., big-O notation).\nAlso, many of the techniques covered in the course build on generic algorithms and data-structures, such as brute-force, iterative improvement, greedy algorithms, and lists, trees, and queues. All those algorithmic and data concepts will not be covered and it is important to know (and master!) them.\nNote that it is not possible to take AI while taking A\u0026amp;A at the same time:\n The reason why A\u0026amp;A is a pre-req (and not a co-req) is that we believe students must know the content of A\u0026amp;A before they start AI. For example, already in week 1 we cover tree traversal and different complexities in big-O notation. That\u0026rsquo;s why A\u0026amp;A is a second year course, and AI is a third year course. :-) Some students enrolled in A\u0026amp;A may claim that they already know the content of A\u0026amp;A, though they are planning to take A\u0026amp;A and AI together. This appears inconsistent and may signal some problem with program planning: why are they taking a course if they already known its content? In those cases, it may be wise to talk to the corresponding Program Manager to take the best of the program. Finally, we should note that both courses AI and A\u0026amp;A are very intense and demanding, so doing them at the same time is not great.  If you think you have covered the topics of A\u0026amp;A in a previous degree or another university, you may be able to claim exception from the pre-req. See above (General section) how to do so.\nI need you to approve the waiver for the pre-req for AI You need to contact the Program Manager of your program, as he/she will be the ultimately making the decision. You need to send the Program Manager all the information required demonstrating that you have evidence to get the exception; for example that you have taken and passed a similar course to Algorithms and Analysis. The Program Manager knows the whole context within your program and he/she will then contact me for advise if needed. This also reduces the chances of misunderstandings, errors, and contradictions caused by different email threads with different people.\nWill AI be offered in Semester 1? In the past it was offered in Semester 1, but with some changes in programs the course was moved to Semester 2. As far as I can tell, there are no current plans to run it in Semester 1. Of course, things change and I am not the one who decides when a course runs, but at this point the course runs in Semester 2.\nIs the AI practical or theoretically oriented? Both. This course has both significant programming as well as significant theoretical content. During the course you will need to program standard AI algorithms (like A*, alpha-beta pruning, RL, or even code in Prolog programming language), but you will also have to calculate conditional probabilities using a Bayesian Network, understand the computational complexity of search algorithms (why is A* exponential in the worst case?), and even be able to mathematically prove why A* algorithm with an admissible heuristic will output an optimal solution. Note these examples are nor pre-req, the course will cover them, but we would expect students to be able to do achieve those tasks. To do so, you need programming and SE skills as well as mathematical and algorithmic backgrounds. That\u0026rsquo;s why the pre-reqs\u0026hellip; ;-)\nWhat programming languages is used in the AI course? It depends on each edition, but since 2017 we have used Python. Before that, we have used C and some Java. Nonetheless, at this stage of the program, students are supposed to be proficient and flexible at programming. For example, many students had their first encounter with Python in this AI course, and they learnt it as part of the course, no problem.\nThe fact is that while being already proficient at the language used may provide benefits and speed up things, the course will not require extremely advanced features and techniques of a particular language that you cannot pick them up during the course itself.\nThere is indeed significant programming work in the course and we expect students, at this stage, to know how to program beyond basic programming.\nI am not enrolled in any program and do not intent to, can I take the AI course? See question \u0026ldquo;*I am not enrolled in any program and do not intent to, can I take course X? *\u0026rdquo; above under General.\nWhat is the syllabus of the course, what topics will be covered? We disclose the exact details of the course in Part B of the Course Overview. Until then I cannot state exactly what the topics will be as they may change from edition to edition.\nSaid so, being an intro course to AI, the topics will at least cover the usual ones in any standard AI intro course: search techniques (including A*), knowledge representation \u0026amp; reasoning, probabilities to reason about uncertainty, and some intro to machine learning.\nCheck Rusell \u0026amp; Norving Modern AI book to have an idea of typical topics covered in an AI intro course.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"352dcfa66d7bd2af9322a50b561bb23e","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/pages/teaching_faq/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pages/teaching_faq/","section":"pages","summary":"Common questions about courses at RMIT.","tags":null,"title":"Teaching FAQ","type":"pages"}]
