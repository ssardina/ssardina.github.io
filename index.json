In a nutshell, my research seeks better representation models and algorithms for programming intelligent controllers operating in complex and dynamic environments. At RMIT I teach courses mostly related to the mathematical foundations of Computer Science, such as Theory of Computation, Discrete Mathematics, and Artificial Intelligence.\nI am also very interested in bringing Computational Thinking to the community, particularly to children and youth.

Probabilistic goal recognition systems, however, explicitly depend on some degree of sub-optimality to generate probability distributions. We show that, even when an observed agent is only slightly irrational (sub-optimal), state-of-the-art systems produce counter-intuitive results (though these may only become noticeable when the agent is highly irrational). We provide a definition of rationality appropriate to situations where the ground truth is unknown, define a rationality measure (RM) that quantifies an agent's expected degree of sub-optimality, and define an innovative self-modulating probability distribution formula for goal recognition. Our formula recognises sub-optimality and adjusts its level of confidence accordingly, thereby handling irrationality—and rationality—in an intuitive, principled manner. Building on that formula, moreover, we strengthen a previously published result, showing that “single-observation” recognition in the path-planning domain achieves identical results to more computationally expensive techniques, where previously we claimed only to achieve equivalent rankings though values differed.","tags":["planning","goal_recognition","ssardina","ssardina-core"],"title":"Expecting the unexpected: Goal recognition for rational and irrational agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan D.

The fairness assumptions are of the form A/B and say that state trajectories that contain infinite occurrences of an action a from A in a state s and finite occurrence of actions from B, must also contain infinite occurrences of action a in s followed by each one of its possible outcomes. The infinite trajectories that violate this condition are deemed as unfair, and the solutions are policies for which all the fair trajectories reach a goal state. We show that strong and strong-cyclic FOND planning, as well as QNP planning, a planning model introduced recently for generalized planning, are all special cases of FOND planning with fairness assumptions of this form which can also be combined. FOND+ planning, as this form of planning is called, combines the syntax of FOND planning with some of the versatility of LTL for expressing fairness constraints. A new planner is implemented by reducing FOND+ planning to answer set programs, and the performance of the planner is evaluated in comparison with FOND and QNP planners, and LTL synthesis tools.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","automated_planning","fond","asp"],"title":"Flexible FOND Planning with Explicit Fairness Assumptions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Width Based Planning searches for solutions through a general measure of state novelty.

Contemporary solutions for general task-planning relate the probability of a goal to the cost of reaching it. We adapt this approach to goal recognition in the strict context of path-planning. We show (1) that a simpler formula provides an identical result to current state-of-the-art in less than half the time under all but one set of conditions. Further, we prove (2) that the probability distribution based on this technique is independent of an agent's past behaviour and present a revised formula that achieves goal recognition by reference to the agent's starting point and current location only. Building on this, we demonstrate (3) that a Radius of Maximum Probability (i.e., the distance from a goal within which that goal is guaranteed to be the most probable) can be calculated from relative cost-distances between the candidate goals and a start location, without needing to calculate any actual probabilities. In this extended version of earlier work, we generalise our framework to the continuous domain and discuss our results, including the conditions under which our findings can be generalised back to goal recognition in general task-planning.","tags":["goal_recognition agents","ssardina","ssardina-core","automated_planning"],"title":"Cost-Based Goal Recognition in Navigational Domains","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"One of our AI planners has been used ove 1M times @ editor.planning.domains.

First, we develop a declarative characterization of the standard \\\"fairness\\\" assumption on environments in non-deterministic planning, and show that strong-cyclic plans are correct solution concepts for fair environments. This complements, and arguably completes, the existing foundational work on non-deterministic planning, which focuses on characterizing (and computing) plans enjoying special \\\"structural\\\" properties, namely loopy but closed policy structures. Second, we provide an encoding suitable for reactive synthesis that avoids the naive exponential state space blowup.

A trap is a conditional invariant: once a state is reached that makes the trap true, all the states that are reachable from it will satisfy the trap formula as well. Finally, dead-ends are formulas that are satisfied in states that make the goal unreachable. We introduce a preprocessing algorithm that computes traps in k-DNF form that is exponential in the k parameter, and show how the algorithm can be used to precompute invariants and dead-ends. We report also preliminary tests that illustrate the effectiveness of the preprocessing algorithm for identifying dead-end states, and compare it with the identification that follows from the use of the h^1 and h^2 heuristics that cannot be preprocessed, and must be computed at run time.\n","date":1464825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464825600,"objectID":"790e329e812e7b890127aed6a59e63da","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/project/trapper/","publishdate":"2016-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/trapper/","section":"project","summary":"Invariants, Traps, Un-reachability Certificates, and Dead-end Detection","tags":["AI Planning","Verification"],"title":"Trapper","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We developed a set of tools to run daily competitions in our AI courses at the University of Melbourne and RMIT.

Agent planning programs are finite-state programs, possibly containing loops, whose atomic instructions consist of a guard, a maintenance goal, and an achievement goal, which act as precondition-invariance-postcondition assertions in program specification. Such programs are to be executed in possibly nondeterministic planning domains and their execution requires generating plans that meet the goals specified in the atomic instructions, while respecting the program control flow. In this paper, we define the problem of automatically synthesizing the required plans to execute an agent planning program, propose a solution technique based on model checking of two-player game structures, and use it to characterize the worst-case computational complexity of the problem as EXPTIME-complete. Then, we consider the case of deterministic domains and propose a different technique to solve agent planning programs, which is based on iteratively solving classical planning problems and on exploiting goal preferences and plan adaptation methods. Finally, we study the effectiveness of this approach for deterministic domains through an experimental analysis on well-known planning domains.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","automated_planning","agent_programming","synthesis"],"title":"Agent Planning Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   The Atari 2600 games supported in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) all feature a known initial (RAM) state and actions that have deterministic effects. Classical planners, however, cannot be used off-the-shelf as there is no compact PDDL-model of the games, and action effects and goals are not known a priori. Indeed, there are no explicit goals, and the planner must select actions on-line while interacting with a simulator that returns successor states and rewards. None of this precludes the use of blind lookahead algorithms for action selection like breadth-first search or Dijkstra’s yet such methods are not effective over large state spaces. We thus turn to a different class of planning methods introduced recently that have been shown to be effective for solving large planning problems but which do not require prior knowledge of state transitions, costs (rewards) or goals. The empirical results over 54 Atari games show that the simplest such algorithm performs at the level of UCT, the state-of-the-art planning method in this domain, and suggest the potential of width-based methods for planning with simulators when factored, compact action models are not available.\n","date":1433203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433203200,"objectID":"bf04cfce64bc8bcaa073b28e6e595782","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/project/atari/","publishdate":"2015-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/atari/","section":"project","summary":"Classical Planners playing Atari 2600 games as well as Deep Reinforcement Learning","tags":["AI Planning","ALE","Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)"],"title":"Arcade Learning Environment","type":"project"},{"authors":["Max Waters","Lin Padgham","Sebastian Sardina"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642245037,"objectID":"8b746ac99fdb9e08b054b5da9b6e5fb6","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/publication/waters-padgham-sardina-jaamas-15/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T11:10:37.597994Z","relpermalink":"/publication/waters-padgham-sardina-jaamas-15/","section":"publication","summary":"The Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agent paradigm provides a powerful basis for developing complex systems based on autonomous intelligent agents. These agents have, at any point in time, a set of intentions encoding the various tasks the agent is working on. Despite its importance, the problem of selecting which intention to progress at any point in time has received almost no attention and has been mostly left to the programmer to resolve in an application-dependent manner. In this paper, we implement and evaluate two domain-independent intention selection mechanisms based on the ideas of enablement checking and low coverage prioritisation. Through a battery of automatically generated synthetic tests and one real program, we compare these with the commonly used intention selection mechanisms of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Round Robin (RR). We found that enablement checking, which is incorporated into low coverage prioritisation, is never detrimental and provides substantial benefits when running vulnerable programs in dynamic environments. This is a significant finding as such a check can be readily applied to FIFO and RR, giving an extremely simple and effective mechanism to be added to existing BDI frameworks. In turn, low coverage prioritisation provides a significant further benefit.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","bdi","agent_programming"],"title":"Improving Domain-Independent Intention Selection in BDI Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project we showed how to compute infinte plans for LTL goals.

In particular, we investigate techniques to synthesize a controller implementing a fully controllable target behavior by suitably coordinating available partially controllable behaviors that are to execute within a shared, fully observable, but partially predictable (i.e., non-deterministic), environment. Both behaviors and environment are represented as arbitrary finite state transition systems. The technique we propose is directly based on the idea that the controller job is to coordinate the concurrent execution of the available behaviors so as to “mimic” the target behavior. To this end, we exploit a variant of the formal notion of simulation to formally capture the notion of “mimicking”, and we show that the technique proposed is sound and complete, optimal with respect to computational complexity, and robust for different kind of system failures. In addition, we demonstrate that the technique is well suited for highly efficient implementation based on synthesis by model checking technologies, by relating the problem to that of finding a winning strategy in a special safety game and explaining how to actually solve it using an existing verification tool.","tags":["ssardina","ssardina-core","composition","synthesis","rac"],"title":"Automatic Behavior Composition Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f7659a1b0a20b1c9a460b236765ec324","permalink":"https://ssardina.github.io/project/lapkt/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lapkt/","section":"project","summary":"Lightweight Automated Planning ToolKiT (LAPKT) to build, use or extend basic to advanced Automated Planners","tags":["AI Planning"],"title":"LAPKT","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sebastian Sardina is a Professor in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Computing Technologies, RMIT University (Melbourne, AUSTRALIA).
